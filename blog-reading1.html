    <h1>Why do most websites end with .com?</h1>
    <img src="images/com.png">
    <p>Websites end in .com because it is one of the oldest and for sure the most recognizable domain extension in the whole world. .com stands for “commercial” and it was the first choice for those that started a business website in the early days of the internet</p>
<p> com stands for commercial and it was first introduced together with other top-level domain names such as .net,.edu,.gov,.mil,.org,.int. Back then it was more like an experiment since the internet was used mainly by educational, scientific organizations and government entities. .com was related mostly to companies that had some contract with the US government. Gradually it became the number 1 option for all kinds of businesses. The release of those top-level domains was back in 1985.

    Nowadays there is no restriction on what kind of entity can use this domain extension. Even if you start a non-profit organization you can use .com tld (top-level domain). </p>
